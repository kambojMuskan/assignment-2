<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>

      
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first

And you (you), you are (you are) my universe, and I
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe, and I
In the night, I lie and look up at you
In the night, I lie and look up at you

When the morning comes, I watch you rise
When the morning comes, I watch you rise

There's a paradise they couldn't capture
There's a paradise they couldn't capture

That bright infinity inside your eyes
That bright infinity inside your eyes
I fly to you every night
매일 밤 네게 날아가 (가)

Forgetting what a dream is
꿈이란 것도 잊은 채

I meet you with a smile (me)
나 웃으며 너를 만나 (나)

Never-ending forever, baby
Never-ending forever, baby
<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>

And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first

And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe

And you make my world light up inside
And you make my world light up inside
Darkness was more comfortable for me
어둠이 내겐 더 편했었지

In the long shadows (eyes)
길어진 그림자 속에서 (eyes)

And they said that we can't be together
And they said that we can't be together

Because, because we come from different sides
Because, because we come from different sides
<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>

And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first

<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>

And you make my world light up inside
And you make my world light up inside
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)

My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)

My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)

(You make my world)
(You make my world)

You make my world light up inside
You make my world light up inside

You make my world light up inside
You make my world light up inside
what illuminates me
나를 밝혀주는 건

A star embroidered with the love that is you
너란 사랑으로 수 놓아진 별

you in my universe
내 우주의 넌

making another world
또 다른 세상을 만들어 주는 걸

you are my star and my universe
너는 내 별이자 나의 우주니까

Because this ordeal is short-lived in the end
지금 이 시련도 결국엔 잠시니까

You always shine brightly like now
너는 언제까지나 지금처럼 밝게만 빛나줘

We will embroider this long night with you
우리는 너를 따라 이 긴 밤을 수놓을 거야
fly with you
너와 함께 날아가 (가)

When I'm without you, I'm crazy
When I'm without you, I'm crazy

Come on, take my hand (ah)
자 어서 내 손을 잡아 (아)

We are made of each other, baby
We are made of each other, baby
<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>

And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first

<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>

And you make my world light up inside
And you make my world light up inside
My universe (you, you are)
My universe (you, you are)

My universe (I just want)
My universe (I just want)

<div class="universe">
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
You (you), you are (you are) my universe</div>
